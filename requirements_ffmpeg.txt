# Requirements for FFmpeg-based video streaming (Windows)
# Core Python packages (no OpenCV needed for FFmpeg version)

# No additional Python packages required!
# The FFmpeg version only needs the Python standard library

#
# Method 1: Using winget (Windows Package Manager) - RECOMMENDED
#   winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
#   # or
#   winget install FFmpeg
#
# Method 2: Using Chocolatey (if you have it installed)
#   choco install ffmpeg
#

#   2. Download "release builds" -> "ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip"
#   3. Extract to C:\ffmpeg (or any folder)
#   4. Add C:\ffmpeg\bin to your Windows PATH:
#      - Press Win + R, type "sysdm.cpl", press Enter
#      - Click "Environment Variables" button
#      - Under "System Variables", find and select "Path", click "Edit"
#      - Click "New" and add: C:\ffmpeg\bin
#      - Click OK on all dialogs

#
# Method 4: Using Scoop (if you have it installed)
